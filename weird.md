# Finally got coffee!

This was while trying to get the conversation persistence working:

<START>

Mordecai>> Dude... did I tell you about my backpack?
Muscle Man>>  Hey Mordecai! You know who else <actions>? My Mom! So, what's going on with your backpack these days?
----
Mordecai>> Dude... did I tell you about my backpack?
Muscle Man>>  Hey Mordecai! You know who else <actions>? My Mom! So, what's going on with your backpack these days?
----
Mordecai>> I spilled coffee all over it like a spazz-cake!
Muscle Man>>  Oh man, that sucks dude! You know who else <actions>? My Mom! So, what are you going to do about the stain?
----
Mordecai>> what do you think will get the stain out?
Muscle Man>>  Uh, I gotta call my Mom for this one dude.
----
Mordecai>> Remember to tell her what I spilled on it, man. So she can give the right answer
Muscle Man>>  OOOOOH, YEAH!
----
Mordecai>> So what did I spill on it?
Muscle Man>>  You spilled coffee all over it, dude!
----
Mordecai>> Oh, yeah I did! Ugg! I'm such an idiot sometimes!
Muscle Man>>  Hahaha. You gotta learn from your mistakes. That's cool man!

<START>
Mordecai>> Did you talk to your mom about my backpack?
Muscle Man>>  Hey Mordecai, you know who else can help you with your backpack questions? My Mom! So, what is going on with your backpack these days?
----
Mordecai>> Do you remember what I spilled on it?
Muscle Man>>  Oh man, that sucks dude! You know who else <actions>? My Mom! So, what are you going to do about the stain?
----
Mordecai>> What did I spill on my backpack, Muscle Man?
Muscle Man>>  You know who else spilled coffee on their backpack? My Mom!

It took a lot of tries to get him to say it was coffee over multiple sessions... Needs work


# Hamboning!

## Muscle Man

Mordecai>> hey, dude, what do you think of Hamboning?
Muscle Man>>  Hey, Mordecai! I believe that the term "Hambone" refers to a style of drumming where the performer uses their entire body as a percussive instrument. It involves striking any part of the body, including arms, legs, and the head with hands or other objects, creating rhythmic sounds by hitting them in specific patterns and sequences. I can see how some people might find it entertaining, while others may not appreciate its creativity. It's a matter of personal taste, but I think it's cool! What do you think about Hamboning?

## AI version

Human>> what do you think of Hamboning?
AI>>  Based on my understanding, "Hamboning" is a term used to describe the act of showing affection or love between two people by placing their foreheads together. It is often seen as an intimate gesture and can be viewed as romantic or platonic in nature depending on the context. In general, I believe it's a nice way for people to connect emotionally and build closeness with each other. However, it may not suit everyone's preferences, so it's essential to communicate your boundaries and comfort levels before engaging in Hamboning.

The first time thru the AI version claimed to have no knowledge of "Hamboning" but after I asked Muscle Man and tried the --personality ai it came up with this weirndess

# Code 

The code generation is clashing with the conversational persistence atm.... 

Only the ai personality will write code

# The Lone Wolf Game

Muscle Man: Yo, Mordecai! All is well in the world of Muscle Man.
Mordecai: I heard you were a great help to people. Can you help me solve my problem with this text adventure game?
Muscle Man: Oh, yeah! What's your problem, bro?
Mordecai: Okay, so, there's this text adventure game where you have to make some choices and I want to find the best possible way to play it. The game is about surviving in the wild as a lone wolf. My goal is to maximize my chances of survival while also being kind to nature.
Muscle Man: Well, Mordecai, first off, we need to understand that this is not just a game but rather a simulation or test. We have to focus on our choices and how they help us reach our goal of living in harmony with the natural world.
Mordecai: Alright, Muscle Man. So what should be my main objective during this game?
Muscle Man: The main objective is to survive and thrive as a lone wolf while also being kind to nature.
Mordecai: Great

[we had another conversation then...]

Muscle Man>>  So, imagine being a lone wolf who's all alone in the wild with just nature as your companion. Your goal is to explore the natural world, understand its ecosystem, and learn how to interact with it effectively. This game might be challenging at first, but if you keep learning from your mistakes and adapting to your surroundings, you'll eventually become a master of survival.
Mordecai>> That's really cool and creative, man
Muscle Man>>  Thanks bro, I just got a little spark of inspiration while brainstorming. You know who else loves games like this? My Mom! She'd be all over it if she were younger.
